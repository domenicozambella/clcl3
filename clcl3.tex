\section{Structures with a standard sort}

Let \emph{$S$\/} be some Hausdorff compact topological space.
We associate to $S$ a first order structure in a language \emph{${\EuScript L}_{\sf S}$\/} that has a symbol for each regular compact subset $C\subseteq S^n$ and a function symbol for each continuous functions $f:S^n\to S$.
According to the context, $C$ and $f$ denote either the symbols of ${\EuScript L}_{\sf S}$ or their interpretation in the structure $S$.

Throughout these notes the letter $C$ always denotes a regular compact subset of $S^n$, or a tuple of such sets.

% Finally, note that we could allow in ${\EuScript L}_{\sf S}$ relation symbols for all compact subsets of $S^n$, for any $n$.
% But this would clutter the notation adding very little to the theory.
% When needed, we will assume this generalization and leave the detail to the reader.

We also fix an arbitrary first-order language which we denote by \emph{${\EuScript L}_{\sf H}$\/} and call the language of the home sort.

\begin{definition}\label{def_0}
  Let \emph{${\EuScript L}$\/} be a two sorted language. 
  The two sorts are denoted by \emph{${\sf H}$} and \emph{${\sf S}$.} 
  The language ${\EuScript L}$ expands ${\EuScript L}_{\sf H}$ and ${\EuScript L}_{\sf S}$ with symbols sort ${\sf H}^n\times{\sf S}^m\to {\sf S}$.
  An \emph{${\EuScript L}$-structure\/} is a structure of signature ${\EuScript L}$ that interprets these symbols in equicontinuous functions (i.e.\@ uniformly continuous w.r.t.\@ the variables in ${\sf H}$).

  A \emph{standard structure\/} is a two-sorted ${\EuScript L}$-structure of the form $\langle M,S\rangle$, where $M$ is any structure of signature ${\EuScript L}_{\sf H}$ and $S$ is fixed.
  Standard structures are denoted by the domain of their home sort.
\end{definition}

We denote by ${\EuScript F}$ the set of ${\EuScript L}$-formulas constructed inductively from atomic formulas of the form (i) and (ii) below using Boolean connectives $\wedge$, $\vee$; the quantifiers $\forall\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf H}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$, $\exists\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf H}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$ of sort ${\sf H}$; and the quantifiers $\forall\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf S}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$, $\exists\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf S}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$ of sort ${\sf S}$.

We write \emph{$x\in C$\/} for the predicate associated to a compact set $C$, and denote by $|\mbox{-}|$ the length of a tuple.

\begin{definition}
  We call atomic formulas those of the form
  \begin{itemize}
  \item[i.] atomic and negated atomic formulas of ${\EuScript L}_{\sf H}$ but not equalities and inequalities
  \item[ii.] $\tau\in C$, where $\tau$ is a $k$-tuple terms of sort ${\sf H}^n\times {\sf S}^m\to {\sf S}$, and $C\subseteq S^k$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition}

% \begin{remark}
%   A smaller fragment of ${\EuScript F}$ may be of interest in some specific contexts.
%   This is obtained by excluding equalities and inequalities from (i) and requiring that $C$ in (ii) is a regular compact set.
%   The discussion below applies to this smaller fragment as well.
% \end{remark}

 Let $M\subseteq N$ be standard structures.
 We say that $M$ is an \emph{${\EuScript F}$-elementary\/} substructure of $N$ if the latter models all ${\EuScript F}(M)$-sentences that are true in $M$.

 Let $x$ and $\xi$ be variables of sort ${\sf H}$, respectively ${\sf S}$.
 A standard structure $M$ is \emph{${\EuScript F}$-saturated\/} if it realizes every type $p(x\,;\xi)\subseteq{\EuScript F}(A)$, for any $A\subseteq M$ of cardinality smaller than $|M|$, that is finitely consistent in $M$.
 The following theorem is proved in \cite{clcl} for signatures that do not contain symbols sort ${\sf H}^n\times{\sf S}^m\to {\sf S}$ with $n{\cdot}m>0$.
 A similar framework has been independently introduced in \cite{PC}~--~only without quantifiers of sort {\sf H} and with an approximate notion of satisfaction.
 The corresponding compactness theorem is proved there with a similar method.
 The setting in \cite{PC} is a generalization of that used by Henson and Iovino for Banach spaces~\cite{HI}.
 By the elimination of quantifiers of sort {\sf S}, proved in \cite{clcl}*{Proposition 3.6}, the two approaches are equivalent~--~up to approximations.

 In \cite{Z} it is observed that, under the assumption of equicontinuity, the proof in \cite{clcl} extends to the case $n{\cdot}m> 0$.

 \begin{theorem}[ (Compactness)]%
  Every standard structure has a ${\EuScript F}$-saturated ${\EuScript F}$-elementary extension.
\end{theorem}

We introduce some new sorts ${\sf X}_k$ with the sole scope of conveniently describing classes of ${\EuScript F}$-formulas that only differ by the sets/predicates $C\subseteq S^k$ they contain.
Let ${\EuScript F}_{\sf X}$ be defined as ${\EuScript F}$ but replacing (ii) with\smallskip

\begin{itemize}
  \item[iii.] $\tau(x\,;\xi)\in X$, where $X$ is a variable of sort ${\sf X}_k$.
\end{itemize}

Formulas in ${\EuScript F}_{\sf X}$ are denoted by $\varphi(x\,;\xi;X)$, where $X=X_1,\dots,X_n$ be a tuple of variables of sort ${\sf X}_{k_1},\dots,{\sf X}_{k_n}$.
If $C=C _1,\dots,C_n$ is a tuple of regular compact subsets of  $S^{k_1},\dots,S^{k_n}$, then $\varphi(x\,;\xi;C)$, is a formula in ${\EuScript F}$.
This we call an \emph{instance\/} of $\varphi(x\,;\xi;X)$.
All formulas in ${\EuScript F}$ are instances of formulas in ${\EuScript F}_{\sf X}$.

\begin{definition}
   Let $\varphi\in{\EuScript F}_{\sf X}$ be a formula~--~possibly with some (hidden) free variables.
   The \emph{pseudonegation\/} of $\varphi\in{\EuScript F}_{\sf X}$ is the formula obtained by replacing in $\varphi$ the atomic formulas in  ${\EuScript L}_{\sf H}$ by their negation and every connective $\wedge$, $\vee$, $\forall$, $\exists$
   %$\forall\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf H}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$, $\exists\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf H}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$, $\forall\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf S}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$, $\exists\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf S}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$ 
   by their respective duals $\vee$, $\wedge$, $\exists$, $\forall$.
  % $\exists\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf H}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$, $\forall\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf H}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$, $\exists\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf S}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$, $\forall\raisebox{1.1ex}{\scaleto{\sf S}{.8ex}\kern-.2ex}$.
   
  The pseudonegation of $\varphi$ is denoted by \emph{${\sim}\varphi$.}
  Clearly, when $X$ does not occur in $\varphi$, we have ${\sim}\varphi\leftrightarrow\neg\varphi$.
\end{definition}


The following fact is immediate and will be used without further mention.

\begin{fact}\label{fact_trivial}
  The following hold for every $C\subseteq C'$ and $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$, every standard structure $M$, and every formula $\varphi(X)\in{\EuScript F}_{\sf X}(M)$

  \ceq{\hfill M}{\models}{\phantom{\sim}\varphi(C)\ \rightarrow\phantom{\neg}\varphi(C')}\smallskip

  \ceq{\hfill M}{\models}{{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)\ \rightarrow\neg\varphi(C).}\smallskip
  
\end{fact}

\begin{fact}
  For every $C\subseteq C'$ there is a $\tilde C\subseteq C'$ disjoint from $C$ such that\smallskip
  
  \ceq{\hfill M}{\models}{\varphi(C)\ \rightarrow\ \neg\,{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)\ \rightarrow\ \varphi(C')}\smallskip

  for every $M$, and every $\varphi(X)\in{\EuScript F}_{\sf X}(M)$.
  Conversely, for every $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$ there is a $C'\supseteq C$ such that

  \ceq{\hfill M}{\models}{\varphi(C)\ \rightarrow\ \varphi(C')\ \rightarrow\ \neg\,{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)}.\smallskip

  for every $M$, and every $\varphi(X)\in{\EuScript F}_{\sf X}(M)$.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  When $\varphi(X)$ is the atomic formula $\tau\in X$, the first claim holds with $\tilde C=C'\smallsetminus O$ where $O$ is any open set $C\subseteq O\subseteq C'$.
  The second claim holds with as $C'$ any neighborhood of $C$ disjoint from $\tilde C$.
  Induction on the syntax of $\varphi(X)$ proves the general case.
\end{proof}

The above fact has the following useful consequence.

\begin{fact}\label{fact_otto}
  Let $\varphi(X)\in{\EuScript F}_{\sf X}(M)$, where $M$ is a standard structure.
  Then the following are equivalent for every tuple $C$\smallskip
  
    \ceq{\hfill M}{\models}{\phantom{\neg}\varphi(C)\ \leftarrow\ \bigwedge\Big\{\ \varphi(C')\ :\ C'\textrm{ neighborhood of }C\Big\} }\smallskip

    \ceq{\hfill M}{\models}{\neg\varphi(C)\ \rightarrow\ \bigvee\Big\{{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)\ :\ \tilde C\cap C=\varnothing\Big\}.}\smallskip

  (The converse implications are trivial~--~therefore not displayed.)
\end{fact}


Note that the fact also holds if we restrict the above $C'$ and $\tilde C$ to range over the subsets of some neighboorhood of $C$.

\begin{fact}\label{fact_saturation}
  The equivalent conditions in Fact~\ref{fact_otto} hold in all ${\EuScript F}$-saturated structures.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  \def\medrel#1{\parbox{5ex}{\hfil $#1$}}
  \def\ceq#1#2#3{\parbox[t]{39ex}{$\displaystyle #1$}\medrel{#2}{$\displaystyle #3$}}

  Prove the first of the two implications by induction on the syntax of $\varphi(X)$.
  The existential quantifier of sort {\sf H} is the only connective that requires attention.
  Assume inductively that

    \ceq{\hfill\bigwedge\Big\{\ \varphi(a\,;C')\ :\ C'\textrm{ neighborhood of }C\Big\}}{\rightarrow}{\varphi(a\,;C)}

  holds for every $\varphi(a\,;C)$.
  Then induction for the existential quantifier follows from

    \ceq{\hfill\bigwedge\Big\{\ \exists x\,\varphi(x\,;C')\ :\ C'\textrm{ neighborhood of }C\Big\}}{\rightarrow}{\exists x\,\bigwedge\Big\{\varphi(x\,;C')\ :\ C'\textrm{ neighborhood of }C\Big\} }

    which is a consequence of saturation.
\end{proof}

We say that $M$ is \emph{${\EuScript F}$-maximal\/} if it models all ${\EuScript F}(M)$-sentences that hold in some of its ${\EuScript F}$-elementary extensions.
By the following fact ${\EuScript F}$-saturated structures are ${\EuScript F}$-maximal.

\begin{fact}\label{fact_maximal}
  Let $\varphi(X)\in{\EuScript F}_{\sf X}(M)$.
  Then the following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1.] $M$ is ${\EuScript F}$-maximal
    \item [2.] the equivalent conditions in Fact~\ref{fact_otto} hold for every $\varphi(C)$. 
  \end{itemize}
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  1$\Rightarrow$2.
  If (2) in Fact~\ref{fact_otto} fails, $\neg\varphi(C)\wedge\neg\,{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)$ holds in $M$ for every $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$.
  Let ${\EuScript U}$ be an ${\EuScript F}$-saturated ${\EuScript F}$-elementary extension of $M$.
  As $M$ is ${\EuScript F}$-maximal, $\neg\varphi(C)\wedge\neg\,{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)$ holds also in ${\EuScript U}$.
  Then (2) in Fact~\ref{fact_otto} fails in ${\EuScript U}$, contradicting Fact~\ref{fact_saturation}.

  2$\Rightarrow$1. 
  Let $N$ be any ${\EuScript F}$-elementary extension of $M$.
  Suppose $N\models\varphi(C)$.
  By (2), it suffices to prove that $M\models\varphi(C')$ for every $C'$ neighborhood of $C$.
  Suppose not. Then, by (2) in Fact~\ref{fact_otto}, $M\models{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)$ for some $\tilde C\cap C'=\varnothing$.
  Then $N\models{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)$ by ${\EuScript F}$-elementarity.
  As $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$, this contradicts Fact~\ref{fact_saturation}.
\end{proof}

In what follows we fix a large saturated standard structure which we denote by \emph{${\EuScript U}$.}

% Unless otherwise specified, we work inside ${\EuScript U}$.
% Let $\varphi(X)\in{\EuScript F}_{\sf X}({\EuScript U})$ be given. Define

% \ceq{\hfill C_{\varphi}}{=}{\big\{\alpha\ :\ \varphi(C) \text{ holds for every } C \text{ neighborhood of } \alpha \big\}}

% Then $C_\varphi$ is a closed set.
% Note that either $C_\varphi$ or $C_{\sim\varphi}$ is empty by Fact~\ref{fact_trivial}.

% Let $\varepsilon$ a compact neighborhood of the diagonal of $S^2$.
% If $C$ is a tuple of compact subsets of $S$, we write $C^\varepsilon$ for the tuple whose elements are $\varepsilon$-close to the corresponding elements of $C$.
% For $b,b'\in{\EuScript U}^n$ we write $b\sim_\varepsilon b'$ if $\langle\tau(b,c),\tau(b',c)\rangle\in\varepsilon$ for every term $\tau(z,w)$ of sort ${\sf H}^{n+|w|}\to{\sf S}$ and every $c\in{\EuScript U}^w$.

% Then the equivalence relations $\sim_\varepsilon$ form the base for a uniformity.
% The coursest uniformity that makes every term $\tau(z,c)$ uniformly continuous

% \begin{fact}
%   The following are equivalent 
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item [1.]  $b\sim_\varepsilon b'$.
%     \item [2.] For every $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$, every $c$, every $C$
    
%     \ceq{\hfill \varphi(c\,;b\,;C)}{\Rightarrow}{\varphi(c\,;b'\,;C^\varepsilon)}

%     and the same holds swapping $b$ and $b'$.
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{fact}

\section{A duality in \boldmath$K(S)$}\label{K(S)}

\def\medrel#1{\parbox{5ex}{\hfil $#1$}}
\def\ceq#1#2#3{\parbox[t]{23ex}{$\displaystyle #1$}\medrel{#2}{$\displaystyle #3$}}

Write \emph{$K(S^n)$\/} for the set of compact subsets of $S^n$.
In this section the variable $X$ has sort ${\sf X}_{n_1},\dots, {\sf X}_{n_k}$ and ${\EuScript D}$ and ${\EuScript C}$ range over the subsets of $K(S^{n_1})\times\dots\times K(S^{n_k})$.
We define 

\ceq{\hfill\emph{${\sim}{\EuScript D}$}}{=}{\big\{\tilde C\ :\ \tilde C\cap C\neq\varnothing\text{ for every }C\in{\EuScript D}\big\}.}

The following fact motivates the definition.

\begin{fact}\label{fact_~definibile}
  For every $\varphi(X)$, if ${\EuScript D}=\{C\,:\,\varphi(C)\}$ then ${\sim}{\EuScript D}=\{\tilde C\,:\,{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)\}$
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  We need to prove that 

  \ceq{\hfill{\sim}\varphi(\tilde C)}{\Leftrightarrow}{\text{for every } C,\ \text{ if } C\cap\tilde C=\varnothing\ \text{ then } \neg\varphi(C)}

  Implication $\Rightarrow$ follows immediately from Fact~\ref{fact_trivial}.
  To prove  $\Leftarrow$ assume the r.h.s.
  Then $\neg\varphi(S\smallsetminus O)$ holds for every open set  $O\supseteq\tilde C$.
  From the second implication in Fact~\ref{fact_otto} we obtain ${\sim}\varphi(\tilde C')$ for some $\tilde C\subseteq\tilde C'\subseteq O$.
  As $O$ is arbitrary, we obtain $\varphi(\tilde C)$ from the second implication in  Fact~\ref{fact_otto}.
\end{proof}

We prove a couple of straightforward inclusions.

\begin{fact}\label{fact_~inclusione}
  For every ${\EuScript D}\subseteq{\EuScript C}$ we have ${\sim}{\EuScript C}\subseteq{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.  
  Moreover, ${\EuScript D}\subseteq{\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  Let $C\notin{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
  Then $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$ for some $\tilde C\in{\EuScript D}$.
  As  $\tilde C\in{\EuScript C}$ we conclude that  $C\notin{\sim}{\EuScript C}$.
  For the second claim, let $C\notin{\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
  Then $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$ for some $\tilde C\in{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
  Then $C\notin{\EuScript D}$ follows.
\end{proof}

\begin{fact}
  For every ${\EuScript D}$ the following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1.] ${\EuScript D}={\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
    \item [2.] ${\EuScript D}={\sim}{\EuScript C}$ for some ${\EuScript C}$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{fact}
  
\begin{proof}
  Only 2$\Rightarrow$1 requires a proof.
  From Fact~\ref{fact_~inclusione} we obtain ${\sim}{\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript C}\subseteq{\sim}{\EuScript C}$.
  Assume (2) then ${\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript D}\subseteq{\EuScript D}$ which, again by Fact~\ref{fact_~inclusione}, suffices to prove (1).
\end{proof}

We say that ${\EuScript D}$ is \emph{involutive\/} if ${\EuScript D}={\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
We say that ${\EuScript D}$ is \emph{closed\/} if 

\ceq{\hfill C\in{\EuScript D}}{\Leftrightarrow}{C'\in{\EuScript D}} for every neighborhood $C'$ of $C$.

Note that we are requiring closure in two distintic contexts: topological, and Boolean (upward clousere by inclusion).

\begin{theorem}
  The following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1.] ${\EuScript D}$ is involutive 
    \item [2.] ${\EuScript D}$ is closed.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\noindent\llap{\textcolor{red}{\Large\warning}\kern1.5ex}\ignorespaces
It is not difficult to see that (2) holds if and only if ${\EuScript D}$ is closed in the Vietoris topology and includes all the supersets of its elements.

\begin{proof}
  2$\Rightarrow$1.
  It suffices to prove ${\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript D}\subseteq{\EuScript D}$.
  Let $C\in{\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
  Let $O\supseteq C$ be open.
  Then $S\smallsetminus O\notin{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
  Then $\tilde C\in{\EuScript D}$ for some $\tilde C\subseteq O$.
  Assume (2).
  Then, by $\Rightarrow$ every $C'\supseteq O$ is in ${\EuScript D}$.
  As $O$ is arbitrary, $C\in {\EuScript D}$ by $\Leftarrow$.

  1$\Rightarrow$2.
  It suffices to show that (2) holds with ${\sim}{\EuScript D}$ for ${\EuScript D}$.
  Implication $\Rightarrow$ in the definition of closed is ovious.
  To prove $\Leftarrow$, assume $C\notin{\sim}{\EuScript D}$.
  Then $C\cap\tilde C$ for some $\tilde C\in{\EuScript D}$.
  Let $C'$ be a neighboorhood of $C$ disjoint of $C$.
  Then the r.h.s.\@ of the equivalence fails for $C'$.  
\end{proof}

\section{Stable formulas~--~the finitary case}
\def\medrel#1{\parbox{5ex}{\hfil $#1$}}
\def\ceq#1#2#3{\parbox[t]{22ex}{$\displaystyle #1$}\medrel{#2}{$\displaystyle #3$}}

There is more than one way to define stability in our context.
In this section we present the strongest possible definition.
It is not the most interesting one, but it is very similar to the classical definition, so it is useful for comparison.

Let $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ be a formulas in ${\EuScript F}_{\sf X}({\EuScript U})$.
The variables of sort ${\sf H}$ are partitioned in two tuples $x\,;z$ which may be infinite.
The following is the classical definition of stability which we dub \textit{finitary\/} for the reason explained below.

\begin{definition}\label{def_finitary_stable}\strut
We say that $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$ is  \emph{finitarily stable\/} if for some $m<\omega$ there is no sequence $\langle a_i\,;b_i\ :\ i<m\rangle$ such that for every $i<n$\smallskip

\ceq{\hfill \varphi(a_n\,;b_i\,;C)}{\wedge}{\neg\varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;C)}.
\end{definition}

From Fact~\ref{fact_otto} we easily obtain the following equivalent definition which only mentions formulas in ${\EuScript F}$.
The reader may wish to compare it with Definition/Theorem~\ref{defthm_epsilon_stable}.

\begin{fact}\label{fact_stability_semicalssic}
  The following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1.]  $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$ is finitarily stable
    \item [2.]  for some $m$ there is no sequence $\langle a_i\,;b_i\,;C_i\ :\ i<m\rangle$ such that for every $i<n$\smallskip

    \ceq{\hfill \varphi(a_n\,;b_i\,;C)}{\wedge}{{\sim}\varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;C_n)}\quad and\quad $C\cap C_n=\varnothing$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{fact}

In a classical context, i.e.\@ reling on ${\EuScript L}$-saturation, we can replace $m$ in Definition~\ref{def_finitary_stable} by $\omega$.
But this may not be true if only have ${\EuScript F}$-saturation.
Therefore we dedicate a separate section to the non finitary version of stability.

The following definitions are classical, i.e.\@ they rely on the full language ${\EuScript L}$.
Their ${\EuScript F}$-homologue we will be introduced later.

\begin{definition}\label{def_globaltype}\strut
  A \emph{global $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$-type\/} is a maximally (finitely) consistent set of formulas of the form $\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)$ or $\neg\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)$ for some $b\in{\EuScript U}^{|z|}$.
\end{definition}

In this section the symbol ${\EuScript D}$ always denotes a subset of ${\EuScript U}^z$.

\begin{definition}\label{def_approx}\strut
  We say that ${\EuScript D}$ is \emph{approximable\/} by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$ if for every finite $B\subseteq {\EuScript U}^z$ there is an $a\in {\EuScript U}^x$ such that\smallskip

  \ceq{\hfill b\in {\EuScript D}}{\Leftrightarrow}{\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\hfill for every $b\in B$.
\end{definition}

It goes without saying that these definitions describe two faces of the same coin.
In fact, it is clear that ${\EuScript D}$ is approximable by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$ if and only if  
    
  \noindent\kern-\labelwidth\kern-\labelsep
  \ceq{\hfill p(x)}{=}{\big\{\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)\ :\ b\in{\EuScript D}\big\}\ \ \cup\ \ \big\{\neg\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)\ :\ b\notin{\EuScript D}\big\}}

is a global $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$-type\smallskip

The following theorem says that if $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$ is finitarily stable then global $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$-types are definable.
The proof of the classical case applies verbatim because no saturation is required.
We state it only for comparison with its non finitary counterpart, see Theorem~\ref{thm_epsilon_stability_definability}.

\begin{theorem}
  Let $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$ be finitarily stable.
  Let ${\EuScript D}$ be approximable by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$.
  Then there are some $\langle a_{i,j}\ :\ i< k,\ j<m\rangle$ such that for every $b\in{\EuScript U}^z$\medskip

  \ceq{\hfill b\in{\EuScript D}}{\Leftrightarrow}{\bigvee_{i< k}\ \bigwedge_{j<m}\ \varphi(a_{i,j}\,;b\,;C)}
\end{theorem}

\def\ceq#1#2#3{\parbox[t]{22ex}{$\displaystyle #1$}\medrel{#2}{$\displaystyle #3$}}

In this section  ${\EuScript D}$ is always a subset of ${\EuScript U}^z\times K(S)$ or, more generally, a subset of  ${\EuScript U}^z\times K(S^{n_1})\times\dots\times K(S^{n_k})$.
We write ${\sim}{\EuScript D}$ for the set obtained by applying the definition in Section~\ref{K(S)} to all fibers of ${\EuScript D}$.
We say that ${\EuScript D}$ is involutive/closed if all its fibers are such.

The letters $\varepsilon$ and $\delta$ always denote a compact neighborhood of the diagonal of $S^2$.
By $\varepsilon+\delta$ we denote the composition $\varepsilon\circ\varepsilon$, where the two sets are viewed as relations.

If $C$ is a compact subsets of $S$, we write $C^\varepsilon$ for the set whose elements are $\varepsilon$-close to elements of $C$.
This definition extends naturally to when $C=C_1,\dots,C_k$ where each $C_i$ is a compact subset of $S^{n_i}$.

\begin{definition}\strut
  We say that $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ is \emph{stable\/} if there is no sequence $\langle a_i\,;b_i\ :\ i<\omega\rangle$ such that for some $C$, some $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$, and for every $i<n$\smallskip

    \ceq{\hfill \varphi(a_n\,;b_i\,;C)}{\wedge}{{\sim}\varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;\tilde C)}\smallskip

\end{definition}


\begin{definition_theorem}\label{defthm_epsilon_stable}\strut
  We say that $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ is \emph{$\varepsilon$-stable\/} if the following equivalent conditions hold\smallskip
  
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1.]  there is no sequence $\langle a_i\,;b_i\,;C_i\,;\tilde C_i\ :\ i<\omega\rangle$ such that for every $i<n$\smallskip
  
    \ceq{\hfill \varphi(a_n\,;b_i\,;C_i)}{\wedge}{{\sim}\varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;\tilde C_n)}\quad and\quad $C_i^\varepsilon\cap\tilde C_i=\varnothing$.\smallskip

    \item [2.]  there is a maximal $m$ such that some sequence $\langle a_i\,;b_i\,;C_i\,;\tilde C_i\ :\ i<m\rangle$ is such that for every $i<n$

    \ceq{\hfill \varphi(a_n\,;b_i\,;C_i)}{\wedge}{{\sim}\varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;\tilde C_n)}\quad and\quad $C_i^\varepsilon\cap\tilde C_i=\varnothing$.\smallskip    
  \end{itemize}
\end{definition_theorem}

\begin{proof}
  2$\Rightarrow$1. Any counter example to (1) immediately provides a counterexample to (2).

  
  \noindent\llap{\textcolor{red}{\Large\warning}\kern1.5ex}\ignorespaces
  1$\Rightarrow$2. ???
\end{proof}

\begin{theorem}\label{thm_epsilon_stable}
  The following are equivalent\smallskip
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1.] $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ is stable.
    \item [2.] $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ is $\varepsilon$-stable for every $\varepsilon$.
  \end{itemize}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  2$\Rightarrow$1. Given any counter example to (1), let $\varepsilon$ be such that $C^\varepsilon\cap\tilde C=\varnothing$.
  To obtain a counter example to (2), set $C_i=C$ and $\tilde C_i=\tilde C$ for every $i<\omega$. 

  \noindent\llap{\textcolor{red}{\Large\warning}\kern1.5ex}\ignorespaces
  1$\Rightarrow$2. 
  Negate (2). 
  Let $\langle a_i\,;b_i\,;C_i\,;\tilde C_i\ :\ i<\omega\rangle$ be a counter example to (1) in Definition~\ref{defthm_epsilon_stable}. 
  By the compactness of $K(S)$ in the Vietoris topology, there are $C$ and $\tilde C$ such that for infinitely many $i<\omega$ we have
  
  \hfil $C_i\subseteq C^{\delta}$,\quad $C\subseteq C_i^{\delta}$\hfil and \hfil$\tilde C_i\subseteq\tilde C^{\delta}$,\quad $\tilde C\subseteq\tilde C_i^{\delta}$,\hfil

  where $\delta$ is a neighborhood of the diagonal such that $2\delta\subseteq\varepsilon$
  Then, by the definition of $\varepsilon$-stability, we have that for infinitely many $i<\omega$ the following holds
  Then $C^{\delta}\cap\tilde C^{\delta}\varnothing$, therefore a suitable subsequence of $\langle a_i\,;b_i\ :\ i<\omega\rangle$ yields a counter example to stability. 
\end{proof}

\begin{definition}\strut
  A \emph{global $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$-type\/} is a maximally (finitely) consistent set of formulas of the form $\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)$ or ${\sim}\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)$ for some $b\in{\EuScript U}^{|z|}$ and some $C$.
\end{definition}

It is convenient to have a different characterization of global types, therefore  the following definition.

\begin{definition}\label{def_approx_X}\strut
  We say that ${\EuScript D}$ is \emph{approximable\/} by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ if for every finite $B\subseteq{\EuScript U}^z$ there is an $a\in{\EuScript U}^x$ such that\smallskip

  \ceq{1.\hfill \langle b,C\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\quad and\smallskip

  \ceq{2.\hfill\langle b,C\rangle\in {\EuScript D}}{\Leftarrow}{\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\hfill for every $b\in B$ and every $C$.\smallskip
\end{definition}

We remark that, by Facts~\ref{fact_~definibile} and~\ref{fact_~inclusione}, when ${\EuScript D}$ is involutive 
%(1) can be rephrased as
%
% \ceq{\hfill{\sim}\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}{\Rightarrow}{\langle b,C\rangle\in{\sim}{\EuScript D}}\hfill for every $b\in B$ and every $C$.
%
% Analogously, 
(2) can be rephrased as

\ceq{\hfill \langle b,C\rangle\in{\sim}{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{{\sim}\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\hfill for every $b\in B$ and every $C$.

\begin{fact}
  For every involutive ${\EuScript D}$ the following are equivalent
  \begin{itemize}
    \item [1.] ${\EuScript D}$ is approximable by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$
    \item [2.] the following is a global $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$-type\smallskip
    
    \noindent\kern-\labelwidth\kern-\labelsep
    \ceq{\hfill p(x)}{=}{\big\{\phantom{\sim}\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)\ :\ \langle b,C\rangle\in{\EuScript D}\big\}\ \ \cup}\smallskip

    \noindent\kern-\labelwidth\kern-\labelsep
    \ceq{}{~}{\big\{{\sim}\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)\ :\ \langle b,C\rangle\in{\sim}{\EuScript D}\big\}.}
  
  \end{itemize}
\end{fact}

\begin{proof}
  First we prove that $p(x)$ is maximal as soon as it is consistent~--~in fact, this only depends on ${\EuScript D}$ being involutive.
  We need to consider two cases.
  First, assume that $\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)$ is consistent with $p(x)$.
  Then consistency implies that $\langle b,\tilde C\rangle\notin{\sim}{\EuScript D}$ for every $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$.
  But this implies that $C\in{\sim}{\sim}{\EuScript D}={\EuScript D}$, therefore $\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)\in p$.
  The second case is when ${\sim}\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)$ is consistent with $p(x)$.
  This implies that $\langle b,\tilde C\rangle\notin{\EuScript D}$ for every $\tilde C\cap C=\varnothing$.
  Then $\langle b,C\rangle\in{\sim}{\EuScript D}$,  therefore ${\sim}\varphi(x\,;b\,;C)\in p$.

  2$\Rightarrow$1.
  Let $B$ be a given finite subset of ${\EuScript U}^z$.
  The finite consistency of $p(x)$ provides some $a$ such that for every finite $B$ an $a$ such that

  \ceq{\hfill \langle b,C\rangle\in {\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{\phantom{\sim}\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\quad and 
  
  \ceq{\hfill \langle b,C\rangle\in{\sim}{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{{\sim}\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\hfill for every $b\in B$ and every $C$. 

  By what remarked above, these yield (1) and (2) in Definition~\ref{def_approx_X}.
  
  1$\Rightarrow$2. 
  Let $B$ be given.
  Let $a$ be as in Definition~\ref{def_approx_X}.
  Then, by what remarked above, $a\models p(x)\restriction B$.
\end{proof}

The proof of the main theorem of this section requires the following notion of approximation.
The definition is inspired by the classical notion of approximation from below in~\cite{Z15} where it is used as rephrasing of the notion of honest definability in~\cite{CS}.
Here this notion plays a purely technical role, but we submit it is potentially interesing in itself.

\begin{definition}\label{def_e_approx_X}\strut
  We say that ${\EuScript D}$ is \emph{approximable\/} by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ \emph{from $\varepsilon$-below\/} if for every finite $B\subseteq{\EuScript U}^z$ there is an $a\in{\EuScript U}^x$ such that for every $C$\smallskip

  \ceq{1.\hfill \langle b,C\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\hfill for every $b\in B$ and\smallskip

  \ceq{2.\hfill\langle b,C^\varepsilon\rangle\in {\EuScript D}}{\Leftarrow}{\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\hfill for every $b\in{\EuScript U}^z$.\smallskip
\end{definition}


% We remark that, by Facts~\ref{fact_~definibile} and~\ref{fact_~inclusione}, when ${\EuScript D}$ is involutive 
% %(1) can be rephrased as
% %
% % \ceq{\hfill{\sim}\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}{\Rightarrow}{\langle b,C\rangle\in{\sim}{\EuScript D}}\hfill for every $b\in B$ and every $C$.
% %
% % Analogously, 
% (2) can be rephrased as

% \ceq{\hfill \langle b,C\rangle\in{\sim}{\EuScript D}_\varepsilon}{\Rightarrow}{{\sim}\varphi(a\,;b\,;C)}\hfill for every $b\in B$ and every $C$,

% where ${\EuScript D}_\varepsilon=\big\{C^\varepsilon\ :\ C\in{\EuScript D}\big\}$.

% \begin{fact}
%   For every involutive ${\EuScript D}$ the following are equivalent
%   \begin{itemize}
%     \item [1.] ${\EuScript D}$ is approximable
%     \item [2.] ${\EuScript D}$ is $\varepsilon$-approximable by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ for every $\varepsilon$
    
%   \end{itemize}
% \end{fact}

% \begin{proof}
%   Immediate.
% \end{proof}



\begin{theorem}\label{thm_epsilon_stability_definability}
  Let $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ be stable.
  Assume that ${\EuScript D}$ is approximable by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$.
  Then for every $\varepsilon$ there are some $\langle a_{i,j}\ :\ i< k,\ j<m\rangle$ such that for every $b\in{\EuScript U}^z$ and every $C$\medskip

  \ceq{\hfill \langle b,C\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{\bigvee_{i< k}\ \bigwedge_{j<m}\ \varphi(a_{i,j}\,;b\,;C^\varepsilon)}\medskip

  \ceq{\hfill \langle b,C^\varepsilon\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Leftarrow}{\bigvee_{i< k}\ \bigwedge_{j<m}\ \varphi(a_{i,j}\,;b\,;C)}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
  The theorem is an immediate consequence of the following three lemmas.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ be stable.
  Assume that ${\EuScript D}$ is approximable by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ from $\varepsilon$-below.
  Then there is are some $\langle a_i\ :\ i<k\rangle$ such that for every $b\in{\EuScript U}^z$ and every $C$\medskip

  \ceq{1.\hfill \langle b,C\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{\bigvee_{i<k}\ \varphi(a_i\,;b\,;C^\varepsilon)}\medskip 

  \ceq{2.\hfill \langle b,C^\varepsilon\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Leftarrow}{\bigvee_{i<k}\ \varphi(a_i\,;b\,;C)} 
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  We define recursively the required parameters $a_i$ together with some auxiliary parameters $b_i$.
  The element $a_n$ is choosen such that

\ceq{3.\hfill \langle b,C^\varepsilon\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Leftarrow}{\varphi(a_n\,;b\,;C)}\hfill for every $b\in{\EuScript U}^z$ and every $C$

and

\ceq{4.\hfill \langle b_i,C\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{\varphi(a_n\,;b_i\,;C)}\hfill for every $i<n$ and every $C$.\smallskip

This is possible because ${\EuScript D}$ is $\varepsilon$-approximated from below.
Note that (3) immediately guarantees (2).
Now, assume (1) fails for $k=n$, and choose $b_n$ and $C_n$ witnessing this.
Then, by Fact~\ref{fact_otto}, for some $\tilde C_n\cap C_n^\varepsilon=\varnothing$

\ceq{5.\hfill \langle b_n,C_n\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\&}{\bigwedge_{i<n}\ {\sim}\varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;\tilde C_n)}%\smallskip

Suppose for a contradiction that the construction never ends.
Then, as (5) guarantees that $\langle b_i,C_i\rangle\in{\EuScript D}$ for every $i$, from (4) we otain $\varphi(a_n\,;b_i\,;C_n)$ for every $i<n$.
From (5) we also obtain ${\sim}\varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;\tilde C_n)$, for every $i\le n$.
This contradicts stability.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}
  Let $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$ be $\varepsilon$-stable.
  Assume that ${\EuScript D}$ is approximable by $\varphi(x\,;z\,;X)$.
  Let $m$ be maximal so that a sequence as in (3) of Theorem~\ref{thm_epsilon_stable} exists.
  Let $\bar x=\langle x_i\ :\ i\le m\rangle$ where the $x_i$ are copies of $x$.
  Then the formula\smallskip

  \ceq{\hfill\sigma(\bar x\,;z\,;X)}{=}{\bigwedge_{i\le m}\ \varphi(x_i\,;z\,;X)}\smallskip

  approximate ${\EuScript D}$ from $\varepsilon$-below.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Negate the claim and let $B$ witness that $\sigma(\bar x)$ does not approximate ${\EuScript D}$ from $\varepsilon$-below.
  Suppose that $a_0,\dots,a_{n-1}$ and $b_0,\dots,b_{n-1}$ have been defined.
  Choose $a_n$ such that for every $b\in B\cup\{b_0,\dots,b_{n-1}\}$ and every $C$

  \ceq{1.\hfill\langle b,C\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{\varphi(a_n\,;b\,;C)}\quad and

  \ceq{2.\hfill\langle b,C^\varepsilon\rangle\in{\EuScript D}}{\Leftarrow}{\varphi(a_n\,;b\,;C^\varepsilon)}
  
  Note that the latter implication is equivalent to: for every $C$ there is some  $\tilde C\cap C^\varepsilon=\varnothing$ such that 
  
  \ceq{3.\hfill \langle b,C^\varepsilon\rangle\notin{\EuScript D}}{\Rightarrow}{{\sim}\varphi(a_n\,;b\,;\tilde C)}.%\hfill  for every $b\in B\cup\{b_0,\dots,b_{n-1}\}$.

  Now, as the lemma is assumed to fail, we can choose $b_n$ and $C_n$ such that

  \ceq{4.\hfill \langle b_n,C_n^\varepsilon\rangle\notin{\EuScript D}}{\&}{\bigwedge_{i=0}^n\ \varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;C_n)}

  Note that (4) ensure that $\langle b_i,C_i^\varepsilon\rangle\notin{\EuScript D}$ for every $i$.
  The there is some $\tilde C_i$ that witnesses (3) for $\langle b_i,C_i^\varepsilon\rangle\notin{\EuScript D}$.
  We claim that the procedure has to stop after $\le m$ steps. 
  In fact, from (3) we obtain ${\sim}\varphi(a_n\,;b_i\,;\tilde C_i)$ for every $i<n$.
  On the other hand, by (4) we have that $\varphi(a_i\,;b_n\,;C_n)$ for every $i<n$.
  Therefore, $\langle a_{m-i}\,;b_{m-i}\,;C_{m-i}\,;\tilde C_{m-i}\ :\ i\le m\rangle$ contradicts the maximality of $m$.
\end{proof}

\begin{lemma}\label{lem_sigma_stable}
  If $\varphi(x\,;z\,;C)$ is stable then $\sigma(\bar x\,;z\,;C)$ in the previous lemma is $\varepsilon$-stable.
\end{lemma}

\begin{proof}
  Let $\varepsilon$ be given and let $m$ be maximal such that a sequence as in (3) of Theorem~\ref{thm_epsilon_stable} exists.
  Let $k$ be suffinciely large so that every $m$-coloring of a graph of size $k$ has a monocromatic subgraph of size $>m$.
  Let $\langle \bar a_i\,;b_i\,;C_i\,;\tilde C_i\ :\ i<k\rangle$ be a sequence witnessing instability as in (3) of Theorem~\ref{thm_epsilon_stable}.
  Then for every pair $i<n$ there is some $j<m$ such that ${\sim}\varphi(a_{j,n}\,;b_i\,;\tilde C_i)$.
  By the choice of $k$ there is a $j<m$ such that ${\sim}\varphi(a_{j,n}\,;b_i\,;\tilde C_i)$ obtains for $>m$ many $i$.
  Then we can extract a subsequence that contradicts the maximality of $m$.
